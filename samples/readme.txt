Here are implementations of a couple of programs from the "computer language shootout benchmarks".

They were basically translated directly from the Lua implementation.

Performance is predictably slow for a first-generation interpreted language. On the order of 10-15x slower than lua and 5-10x slower than ruby.

Not impressive performance wise, but for a very early implementation there's probably a lot of low-hanging optimization
