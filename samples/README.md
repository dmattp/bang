Here are a few samples / test programs.

The quicksort implementation is idiomatic Bang! code.  Several others are implementations of the "computer language shootout" benchmarks and were translated from the available Lua implementation, so they may not be very idiomatic or comprehensible.  I don't really understand what most of the programs are doing myself, mostly they're straight translations, possibly mucked up even more incomprehensibly for trying to tweak the performance a bit here and there.

There's also a slew of simpler samples in the [test] directory.
