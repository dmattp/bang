Bang! supports two build mechanisms, GNU toolchain / GNU Make and MSVC / MSBuild project files.

GNU Toolchain / Makefile
=================================
Edit Makefile to customize options for your build.  There are typical configuration files in the
[build] directory which provide reasonable settings for either a typical MinGW build (build/win32.mak)
or a typical linux build (build/linux.mak).

MSVC / MSBuild / .vcxproj files
=================================
There are several .vcxproj files, one for the main intrepreter (bang.vcxproj) and others for the
compiled libraries (stringlib.vcxproj and mathlib.vcxproj).  These can generally be built from
the command line using e.g., "MSBuild /p:Configuration=Release bang.vcxproj", or they can be
opened in visual studio and built from within the IDE.

Building with Boehm GC
=================================
For GNU builds, set the USE_GC variable in Makefile to 1.  In your [build/site.mak] specify path
to the Boehm header / library files as needed.

For MSVC builds, edit [build/site.props] to set location of Boehm GC build header and library directories.
